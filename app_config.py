## What is Exemplar-based Video Colorization?

Exemplar-based video colorization is a technique used to add color to black-and-white or monochrome videos. It leverages the concept of exemplars, which are reference images that contain color information similar to the target video frames. By analyzing the exemplars and the target frames, the colorization algorithm transfers the colors from the exemplars to the corresponding regions in the target frames.

Our proposed model represents a significant advancement in video colorization technology. By harnessing the potential of the Vision Transformer architecture, specifically the Swin Transformer variant, we have established a state-of-the-art solution that combines exceptional speed optimization with the generation of colorful and vivid videos. The benchmark results are shown in the "Report" above.
